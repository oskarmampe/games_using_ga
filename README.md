## Evolutionary Games using Genetic Algorithms

Extension to the basic python program. This version uses a genetic algorithm, that I have built without the use of any libraries apart from standard (std) ones. The application also uses QT, and it's test suite.

The program was tested on QT Creator 4.13.0, QT 5.15.0 using MinGW 32 and 64 bit versions. The project also uses qmake to compile the program.
